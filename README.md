# Supplemental Mathematica Notebooks to: Novel Universality Classes in Polar Active Fluids using Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Methods

This repository contains two Mathematica Notebooks as supplemental material to Patrick Jentsch's PhD thesis "Novel Universality Classes in Polar Active Fluids using Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Methods", giving analytical expressions for graphical corrections.

* Notebook_Chapter_8.nb contains the graphical corrections of chapter 8, after frequency, angular and h_\perp integration, as integrands of the h_x integral in dimensionless form.
* Notebook_Chapter_9.nb contains the graphical corrections of chapter 9, after frequency and angular, as integrands of the p integral in dimensionless form.
